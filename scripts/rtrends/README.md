# Trend Data Directory

This directory is a placeholder for trend data files that are generated by an external scraping system.

## Purpose

Trend data from Reddit and other sources will be placed in these subdirectories by the Reddit scraper tool, which is maintained as a separate repository. The content generation scripts in this template will read the trend files from these directories to create content for the website.

## Directory Structure

- `/scripts/rtrends/` - Base directory for all trend data
  - `/conspiracy/` - Conspiracy-related trend data (XML files)
  - `/usnews/` - US News trend data (XML files)
  - Add additional subdirectories as needed for different trend categories

## File Naming

Trend files should follow a consistent naming pattern:
```
[category]_[timestamp].xml
```

For example:
```
conspiracy_20250428134527.xml
usnews_20250428134527.xml
```

## Integration

The content generation scripts in this template are designed to look for the latest trend files in these directories and use them as sources for generating new content.

To configure how trend files are processed, see the `config/trends.xml` file in this template.
